Problem: 
Locations(GPS co-ordinates)  of 3 ports are given. There are 10 different locaitons where raw materials are produced. 
Find the best possible location of the port, so that transportation cost is minimum.

Given: 
sqllite3 database which has tables location and port is given.


Alogirthm:
Step1)compute the distance from each loaction to port1. 
Step2)Mutiply the distance with tonnage. This is the weight/cost of the route.
Step3)Add up all the costs, to get the cost for the port1.
Step4)Repeat the above step1 to step3 for port2 and port3.
Step5)Get the port with least cost and display it's co-ordinates as the best port


Python Program:

Step1: Import the db using the command
	C:\Sqlite\sqlite3.exe renewable.db

Step2: .tables command on sqlite command prompt tells that there are two tables in the db
1)location 
2)ports


Step3: connect to the renewable database using sqlite3.connect
Step4: Read the data from the tables into pandas dataframe using pandas read_sql_query
Step5: Define a method to caluculate the distance between two sets of co-ordinates. Use Havesine formula to calculate it.
Step6: for every port1, calculate the distance from every loaction. Multiply distance with tonnage to get cost.
Step7: Add all the costs for every port and store in a list
Step8: Get the index of the list with least cost using list.min() 
Step9: Print the co-ordinates of the port with least cost.
